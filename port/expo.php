<div class="projectpictitle"><h2 style="font-size:16px; color:#999999">Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADD/ADHD) is a chronic, debilitating disorder that permeates every aspect of an individual’s life. Children with this disorder often exhibit signs of forgetfulness and disorganization which can cause problems at home and school, while secondary symptoms such as low self-esteem, aggressiveness and emotional immaturity have a significant impact on their daily lives. A home environment that is sensitive to the needs of a child with ADHD and aware of the implications of the disorder is vital for effective, successful treatment. </h2></div>

<div class="projectpictitle"><h2 style="font-size:16px; color:#999999">Interaction Design

	To provide optimal content and a memorable user experience to the child user, one of the most important aspects of design is that the effective use of color and graphics in the child side user interface.
	Bright visuals, bold colors and simple lines make it catch all users’ attention, particularly children. We use large visual elements, display and touch screen, which consider about their dexterity, also easier for them to read and understand. Children are encouraged to discover the multiple facets of the application like how to feed avatar, how to purchase reward items by utilizing visual and audio cues, which could stimulate a child’s mental capabilities and propels him/her towards self-discovery and learning. Children can keep track of the avatar’s status on three status bar on the top one scree and keep the avatar in a health and happy status, which trains the child’s benevolence and responsibility

<div class="projectpictitle"><h2 style="font-size:16px; color:#999999">Given our research findings, we pursued a primarily mobile-based system that we have named Rhea. The system would allow users to check the status of their borrowed, reserved and ordered items, and it would also remind students of those status changes. Rhea focuses on three kinds of user behaviors: borrowing, waiting and ordering, and it mainly has three functions: Reminder, fine calculator, and order manager. Moreover, Rhea enables users to check out the basic information of the library resources in a convergent and consistent way.
