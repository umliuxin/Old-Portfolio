To set up the database for this application,

(1) Copy config-dist.php to config.php and update the values

(2) Run the setup.sql to create the tables and populate the
initial key.

You can change the secret from '12345' to anything you like. 
If you want to change the key - also do a new SHA256 calculation as
that is used as the indexed logical key.  There are many SHA256
calculators on the web.
